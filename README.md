Production-ready bilingual (EN/ZH) studio website built on the BAAM platform.  
It includes public pages, admin CMS, DB-first content storage, file fallback, media tools, and site/domain-aware routing.

---

## 1) Tech Stack

- Next.js App Router (`app/`)
- TypeScript + React
- Tailwind CSS + CSS variables
- Supabase (content/site/admin data + storage)
- JSON content contracts for page and collection data

---

## 2) Quick Start

### Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Default dev port from `package.json`:

- `http://localhost:3050`

### Build and run checks

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

### Full CI-style local check

```bash
npm run ci:check
```

---

## 3) Environment Configuration

Use `.env.local.example` as the starting template.

Key variables:

- `APP_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SITE`
- `SUPABASE_*` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM`, `CONTACT_FALLBACK_TO`, `ALERT_TO`

Important:

- DB-first mode is enabled when `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is present.
- Without it, the app falls back to local `content/` JSON files.
- For this project, ensure the default site points to the active studio site (for example `julia-studio`) rather than legacy template IDs.

---

## 4) High-Level Architecture

### Frontend (public)

- Routes are under `app/[locale]/...`
- Locale-aware pages (`en`, `zh`)
- Shared shell in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
- Theme tokens injected as CSS variables from `theme.json`

### Backend (API)

- Public content APIs under `app/api/content/*`
- Admin APIs under `app/api/admin/*`
- Contact + booking APIs under `app/api/contact` and `app/api/booking/*`

### Data layer

- Content table: `content_entries` (DB-first)
- Optional revisions table: `content_revisions`
- Site/domain management via DB or fallback JSON (`content/_sites.json`, `content/_site-domains.json`)

## 6) Frontend Architecture Details

### 6.1 Locale routing

- Public pages are built under `app/[locale]/...`
- Locale value controls content selection (`en` or `zh`) and text rendering.

### 6.2 Theme system

- Source of truth: `content/<siteId>/theme.json`
- Runtime mapping: `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` -> CSS variables
- Consumption: semantic classes and `var(--token)` usage in components

### 6.3 Page content model

- Page-level JSON: `content/<siteId>/<locale>/pages/*.json`
- Optional layout JSON for section ordering: `*.layout.json`
- Collection JSON folders:
  - `portfolio/`
  - `collections/`
  - `shop-products/`
  - `journal/`
  - `testimonials.json` (array-style collection file)

### 6.4 Public content loading

Used patterns:

- Server loaders (`lib/content.ts`) for DB-first fetch with file fallback
- Public API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/content/file?locale=...&path=...`
  - `GET /api/content/items?locale=...&directory=...`

Guardrail:

- Public pages must not call admin APIs (`/api/admin/*`), especially in production.

---

## 7) Backend/API Architecture

### 7.1 Public APIs

- `app/api/content/file/route.ts`
  - Reads one content file path
  - Supports host-based site inference when `siteId` is omitted
- `app/api/content/items/route.ts`
  - Reads collection directory items
  - Supports host-based site inference when `siteId` is omitted

### 7.2 Admin APIs

Main groups:

- Auth/session/logout
- Content file CRUD + import/export
- Media list/upload/import/provider search
- Site management
- User management
- Booking admin operations

All admin routes are under `app/api/admin/*` and are not for public page rendering.

### 7.3 Contact and booking APIs

- Public contact submission endpoint
- Booking endpoints for service list, slots, create/cancel/reschedule/list

---

## 8) Multi-Site + Domain Resolution

Site resolution priority (simplified):

1. Explicit `siteId` (when provided)
2. Host/domain mapping (`getSiteByHost`)
3. Default enabled site
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SITE`

This logic is implemented through `lib/content.ts` and `lib/sites.ts`.

Operational rule:

- Do not hardcode `siteId` in public page fetches unless there is a strict one-site requirement.

---

## 9) Admin CMS Structure

### 9.1 Main admin areas

- Content editor
- Blog posts / collection management surfaces
- Media manager
- Variants library
- Site settings
- Users
- Sites
- Booking settings and bookings

### 9.2 Content editor design

- `components/admin/ContentEditor.tsx` orchestrates file loading/saving and panel routing.
- Complex forms are extracted into `components/admin/panels/*`.
- Examples include:
  - `TestimonialsPanel.tsx`
  - `ServicesPagePanel.tsx`
  - `ThemePanel.tsx`
  - `JournalItemPanel.tsx`

### 9.3 Form mode + JSON mode

- Form mode: constrained fields, image pickers, dropdowns, add/remove controls
- JSON mode: raw contract editing
- Roundtrip expectation: changes in either mode remain consistent

---

## 10) Content Sync Model (DB <-> Local Files)

Two directions are supported:

- **Import** = DB -> local files
- **Export** = local files -> DB

Recommended workflow:

1. Run check/dry-run first.
2. Review changed counts and folder breakdown.
3. Choose direction explicitly based on source of truth.

Rule of thumb:

- If DB is canonical and conflicts are safe, use Import.
- If local JSON is canonical, use Export.

---

## 11) Data Integrity Rules

- Collection `slug` must match filename stem/path.
- Duplicate/create/save should keep slug/path synchronized.
- Diff checks should include all collection folders to avoid false "no difference" results.

---

## 12) Media and Assets

- Storage target is Supabase media storage in production.
- Admin media flows support upload and provider import/search.
- Content should store media URLs in JSON/DB content entries.

Support scripts:

- `npm run media:migrate`
- `npm run content:normalize-media-urls`

---

## 13) QA and Operational Scripts

Available QA scripts:

- `npm run qa:routes`
- `npm run qa:seo`
- `npm run qa:content`
- `npm run qa:bilingual`
- `npm run qa:all`

Recommended pre-deploy sequence:

1. `npm run ci:check`
2. `npm run qa:all`
3. Manual smoke test (EN/ZH and key listing pages)
4. Content sync dry-run before import/export operations

---

## 14) Deployment Notes

- Deploy target: Vercel
- Ensure production env vars are fully configured
- Confirm domain-to-site mapping in sites/domain config
- Verify public pages load content from host-resolved site in production

Post-deploy checks:

- `/api/health` returns healthy response
- Public pages are non-empty for portfolio/collections/shop/journal
- Admin login and content save operations succeed

---

## 15) Known Platform Guardrails

- Keep public APIs and admin APIs strictly separated.
- Use theme tokens, not ad-hoc hardcoded visual values.
- Keep complex content editing in dedicated admin panels.
- Always decide content sync direction before import/export.
- Prefer host-based site resolution for multi-site safety.

---

## 16) Useful Files to Read First

- `BAAM_MASTER_PLAN_V3_COMPLETE.md`
- `JULIA_STUDIO_COMPLETE_PLAN.md`
- `JULIA_STUDIO_CONTENT_CONTRACTS.md`
- `THEME_NORMALIZATION_SOP.md`

## 17) Current Site Baseline

This repository currently serves as the Julia Studio implementation baseline on BAAM platform architecture.



----------------------------- REB sample site

Here’s what I'm thinking for the website:

domain: www.panorama-realty.com
Company: Panorama NY, Inc
 Address: 444 Peenpack Trl, Huguenot, NY 12746

Needs:

1. Ability to have a mirror site in Chinese

2. Ability for me to easily go into the backend to edit as needed (for example, adding agents, changing text, adding client reviews, various legal language needed, like fair housing disclaimers, etc.) or add additional columns (for example, I have a site, leeshailemish.com on WordPress where I can do all these things)

3. Persistent contact CTA options:

• Chat widget or bot to capture engagement
• Chat/text option
• Sticky header phone/text button
• Floating “Schedule consultation”
• Click-to-call on mobile
 
4. Website good on mobile in general

Goals:

Focus on one primary goal per visitor, with clear entry paths
1. “I want to buy”
2. “I want to sell”
3. “I’m relocating”
4. “I’m an investor”
5. “I’m an agent considering joining”
Everything in the site revolves around: “Why should I trust you with the biggest transaction of my life?”

Structure:

1. Home
a. basic homepage design with logo
b. Bold value proposition
c. Location expertise specificity
d. Trust indicators
e. CTA (contact for free consultation)

3. “I’m relocating”
4. “I’m an investor”
5. “I want to join the team”
h. an intro paragraph about the brokerage and value proposition
i. contact form
j. Featured listings – I can upload these manually or through selection from MLS somehow.

c. Join the team (goes to a separate page for agent recruitment pitch and contact to schedule a conversation)
d. (in the future – awards, additional certifications).
 

3b. Individual agent profiles. Every agent gets a page:

a. Their photo
b. A paragraph or more about themselves
