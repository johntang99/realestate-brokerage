  "body": "## The Numbers Don't Lie\n\nStaged homes sell 73% faster than unstaged homes, according to the National Association of Realtors. My own experience confirms this: among my listings in the past three years, staged properties averaged 16 days on market versus 29 days for unstaged. That's not a small difference.\n\nMore importantly, staged homes sell for more. The return on investment for professional staging typically runs 6-10% of the staged cost — meaning a $3,000 staging investment can yield $15,000+ in additional sale proceeds.\n\nHere's what I advise my sellers:\n\n## Start with Declutter and Deep Clean\n\nBefore a stager sets foot in your home, it needs to be emptied of excess. Pack up personal photos, knick-knacks, extra furniture, and everything stored in closets. Buyers need to see space, not your stuff. Then clean — professionally, ceiling to baseboard. The smell and sparkle of a truly clean home registers immediately with buyers and sets a positive tone for everything they see.\n\n## Prioritize These Rooms in Order\n\n**1. Kitchen** — It sells homes or loses them. Clean grout, new hardware on cabinets, fresh paint if the color is dated, and cleared countertops (keep only one or two attractive items visible) can transform a kitchen's impression without a renovation.\n\n**2. Primary bedroom and bathroom** — Buyers fall in love in the primary suite. Neutral bedding, minimal furniture to maximize perceived size, and a spa-like bathroom (clean caulk, fresh towels, all personal products hidden) make this space aspirational.\n\n**3. Living room** — Pull furniture away from walls, ensure the room has a clear focal point (fireplace, view, or gallery wall), and add one or two fresh plants or flowers.\n\n## Don't Neglect the Outside\n\nFirst impressions happen before buyers walk through the door. Power wash the driveway, add fresh mulch, plant seasonal flowers, replace any outdated light fixtures, and paint the front door. Curb appeal is the most cost-effective investment before listing.\n\n## What Professional Stagers Do That Sellers Can't\n\nStagers understand buyer psychology and how to photograph beautifully. They know which furniture arrangements photograph wide, how to use lighting to flatten unflattering architectural elements, and which art and accessories signal 'aspirational lifestyle' to target buyers.\n\nFor luxury listings ($1.5M+), I work with professional stagers as a standard practice. For entry-to-mid-range listings, a consultation ($300-500) plus following the stager's recommendations yourself often delivers 80% of the benefit at a fraction of the cost.\n\n*Thinking of selling?
