What I discovered was a profession that combined everything I love: people, strategy, local community, and the satisfaction of helping families find their place in the world. Since then, I've closed over 500 transactions and $150M in career sales — but the number that matters most to me is the 500 families who trusted me with their biggest financial decision.","image":"","imageAlt":"Alexandra at a showing"},{"body":"I grew up in Westchester County and raised my own family here. That's not just background — it's expertise. I know which streets flood in spring, which school districts have exceptional arts programs, which neighborhoods are quietly appreciating, and which local lenders will actually get your deal to close on time. That knowledge only comes from living here, and it's the single most valuable thing I bring to every transaction.","image":"","imageAlt":"Alexandra in the community"},{"body":"My philosophy is simple: I treat every client the way I'd want to be treated. I pick up the phone. I tell you the truth about pricing, even when it's not what you want to hear. I stay in your corner through every obstacle, and I don't celebrate until you do. That commitment to genuine service is why over 80% of my business comes from referrals and repeat clients.","image":"","imageAlt":"Alexandra with clients"}] },
