{ "hero": { "variant": "minimal-text", "headline": "Frequently Asked Questions" }, "categories": [{"name":"Buying","items":[{"question":"How long does the home buying process take?","answer":"In Westchester County, expect 60-90 days from accepted offer to closing, depending on financing and attorney schedules. The search phase varies — some clients find the right home in two weeks, others take several months."},{"question":"Do I need to be pre-approved before looking at homes?","answer":"I strongly recommend it. Pre-approval shows sellers you're a serious buyer and prevents heartbreak if you fall in love with a home outside your budget. I'll connect you with trusted local lenders who can pre-approve you quickly."},{"question":"What's the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval?","answer":"Pre-qualification is an estimate based on unverified information. Pre-approval involves verification of income, assets, and credit — it carries real weight in a competitive offer situation."},{"question":"How much are closing costs for buyers in New York?","answer":"Expect 2-5% of the purchase price. In New York, this includes attorney fees, title insurance, mortgage recording tax, and various state and local fees. I'll give you a detailed estimate before you make an offer."},{"question":"Should I waive the home inspection contingency to win a bidding war?","answer":"I strongly advise against waiving the inspection entirely. In competitive markets, you can offer an 'informational only' inspection — meaning you'll do the inspection but only ask for concessions on major structural or safety issues."}]},{"name":"Selling","items":[{"question":"How do you determine the right asking price?","answer":"I prepare a detailed comparative market analysis (CMA) using recent sold data, active competition, and local market trends. Pricing is strategic — too high and you sit; too low and you leave money on the table. My sellers average 101.3% of list price."},{"question":"How long will it take to sell my home?","answer":"In Westchester County, well-priced homes typically sell in 2-4 weeks. My listings average 21 days on market — well below the county average. Overpriced homes can sit for months."},{"question":"Should I renovate before selling?","answer":"It depends on the renovation and your timeline. I'll advise on which updates generate the best ROI and which are unnecessary. Often, professional staging and deep cleaning outperform expensive renovations."},{"question":"What does it cost to sell a home?","answer":"In New York, sellers typically pay: real estate commissions, attorney fees, transfer taxes, and any agreed-upon buyer concessions. I'll prepare a net proceeds estimate before you list."},{"question":"Can you sell my home while I'm still living in it?","answer":"Absolutely — the majority of my listings are occupied. We'll coordinate showings to minimize disruption to your daily life."}]},{"name":"Leasing","items":[{"question":"How do you find tenants for my rental property?","answer":"Professional listing photography, MLS and portal syndication, and my network of relocation clients. I thoroughly screen all applicants: credit check, income verification, employment, and rental history."},{"question":"What's a fair rental price for my property?","answer":"I'll prepare a rental market analysis comparing similar units currently leasing in your neighborhood. Pricing competitively minimizes vacancy — often the biggest cost for landlords."},{"question":"How long is a typical lease term in Westchester?","answer":"12-month leases are standard. Some landlords prefer 24-month terms for stability. I can advise on market preferences in your specific neighborhood."},{"question":"Do you handle commercial leases?","answer":"Yes. Commercial leasing is a specialty area with different legal and financial considerations. I represent both landlords and tenants in commercial lease transactions."}]},{"name":"Commercial","items":[{"question":"What types of commercial properties do you handle?","answer":"Office space, retail, restaurant, industrial, warehouse, medical/professional, and mixed-use properties. Both purchase and lease transactions."},{"question":"How is commercial real estate priced differently from residential?","answer":"Commercial properties are often valued based on their income-generating potential — specifically the cap rate (net operating income divided by purchase price). I'll walk you through the financial analysis for any commercial opportunity."},{"question":"What is a 1031 exchange?","answer":"A 1031 exchange allows investors to defer capital gains taxes when selling an investment property by reinvesting the proceeds into a 'like-kind' property. Timing is strict — you must identify the replacement property within 45 days and close within 180 days. I coordinate with qualified intermediaries."},{"question":"How long do commercial transactions typically take?","answer":"Commercial transactions typically take 60-120 days from accepted offer to closing, depending on due diligence requirements, financing, and lease review."}]},{"name":"Investment","items":[{"question":"Is now a good time to invest in Westchester real estate?","answer":"Westchester County has consistently outperformed national averages in long-term appreciation. Low inventory and strong school district demand make it a resilient market. The right investment depends on your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance — let's discuss."},{"question":"What should I look for in a rental investment property?","answer":"Key metrics include cap rate, cash-on-cash return, price-to-rent ratio, and projected vacancy rate. Location fundamentals — school districts, transit access, employment centers — drive long-term value."},{"question":"Can you help me build a real estate portfolio?","answer":"Absolutely. I work with investors from first rental property through multi-unit portfolios. I can help you identify opportunities, analyze returns, and coordinate 1031 exchanges to grow tax-efficiently."},{"question":"What's the difference between a single-family rental and multi-family?","answer":"Single-family rentals are simpler to manage and finance, but multi-family properties generate multiple income streams. Each has distinct financing rules, management requirements, and return profiles."}]},{"name":"Working With Me","items":[{"question":"How quickly do you respond to inquiries?","answer":"I personally respond to every inquiry within 2 hours during business hours. You'll always reach me directly — no assistants, no voicemail black holes."},{"question":"Do you work with buyers and sellers simultaneously?","answer":"Yes, though I'm always transparent about any potential conflicts of interest. In dual-agency situations, I'll fully explain your options and rights before proceeding."},{"question":"What areas of Westchester County do you cover?","answer":"My primary markets are Scarsdale, Larchmont, Bronxville, Rye, White Plains, Mamaroneck, Eastchester, Tuckahoe, and surrounding communities. I have referral relationships with specialists throughout the county and broader New York metro."},{"question":"How do I get started?","answer":"Call, text, or email me directly. Or fill out the consultation form on this site. I'll respond within 2 hours and we'll schedule a no-pressure introductory conversation."}]}],
