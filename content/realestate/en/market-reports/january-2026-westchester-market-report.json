  "body": "## Executive Summary\n\nWestchester County's real estate market begins 2026 in the same constrained, competitive posture that defined the second half of 2025. Inventory remains at multi-year lows, demand from qualified buyers remains robust, and properly presented homes continue to attract multiple offers.\n\n## Inventory Analysis\n\nThe county closed January with 1,842 active listings — down 12% from the same period last year and the lowest January inventory count since 2018. New listings entering the market (428) fell 8.5% year-over-year, reflecting the persistent 'lock-in effect' among homeowners with sub-4% mortgage rates.\n\nAt the current pace of sales, absorption stands at approximately 5.9 months of supply county-wide — technically a balanced market, but with significant variation by price tier. Below $1M, supply is well under 3 months (a strong seller's market). Above $3M, supply approaches 12+ months.\n\n## Price Trends\n\nThe county-wide median sale price of $875,000 represents a 5.8% year-over-year increase, continuing the steady appreciation trend established in 2024. The appreciation is most pronounced in the $750K-$1.5M range, where competition is most intense.\n\n## Notable Observations\n\n- **Multiple-offer situations** remain common for well-priced properties under $2M in top school districts\n- **Luxury segment ($2M+)** showing pickup in activity, particularly in Scarsdale, Rye, and Harrison\n- **Condo/townhouse market** benefiting from buyers priced out of single-family; White Plains and New Rochelle showing strong condo demand\n- **Commercial and investment** activity remains steady, with office leasing at selective occupancy and multi-family continuing to attract investor interest\n\n## Outlook\n\nI expect Q1 2026 to continue the current pattern. If mortgage rates decline toward 6% — possible if the Fed delivers on current projections — I anticipate a meaningful increase in both listings and buyer activity in Q2 2026. This would be the healthiest development for the market, adding supply while maintaining price stability.",
