  "description": "Nestled on a private cul-de-sac in one of Scarsdale's most desirable neighborhoods, this exquisitely maintained colonial offers the perfect blend of classic architecture and contemporary living. The sun-drenched interior features a grand two-story foyer, formal living and dining rooms, and an open-concept kitchen-to-family room designed for both everyday comfort and effortless entertaining.\n\nThe chef's kitchen boasts Calacatta marble countertops, a Wolf range, Sub-Zero refrigerator, and a large island with seating for four. The adjacent family room opens to a bluestone patio overlooking the manicured backyard — an entertainer's paradise with room for a pool.\n\nUpstairs, the primary suite is a true sanctuary with a spa bathroom, heated floors, and dual walk-in closets. Three additional bedrooms and a beautifully renovated hall bath complete the second floor. A fully finished lower level adds flexible space for a home office, gym, or playroom.",
