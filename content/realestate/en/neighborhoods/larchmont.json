  "overview": "Larchmont is one of those rare communities where everything feels intentionally perfect — the tree-lined streets, the waterfront Manor Park, the village center with its independent shops and restaurants, and the undeniable sense that neighbors actually know each other.\n\nThe Mamaroneck Union Free School District serves Larchmont and has earned a national reputation for academic excellence and program diversity. Larchmont Avenue is a genuine Main Street experience — no chains, all character — and the waterfront access through the Larchmont Manor Park Association is a genuine quality-of-life differentiator.\n\nThe housing stock ranges from early-20th-century Colonials and Tudors to contemporary new construction. Waterfront and water-view properties command significant premiums. The Metro-North New Haven Line connects Larchmont to Grand Central in approximately 35 minutes.\n\nThe community's walkability is exceptional for suburban Westchester. Many residents walk to the train, to restaurants, and to Manor Park without ever needing a car on weekday mornings.",
