  "overview": "Rye occupies a special place in the Westchester County consciousness — it's the community that manages to feel both exclusive and genuinely welcoming. The combination of beach access, top-rated schools, a vibrant downtown, and an active country club scene makes Rye one of the most sought-after addresses in the county.\n\nRye City School District consistently earns recognition as one of the best in New York State. Rye High School's college preparation is exceptional, and the district's arts and athletics programs are standouts.\n\nRye Beach and Playland State Park provide summer recreational opportunities that most Westchester communities can only envy. The private Rye Golf Club and the Apawamis Club serve as social centers for much of the community. Rye's downtown Purchase Street is one of Westchester's most vital commercial corridors, with an excellent mix of restaurants, boutiques, and essential services.\n\nThe Metro-North New Haven Line connects Rye to Grand Central Terminal in approximately 42 minutes. The Rye housing market is competitive in all price ranges, from modest starter homes to multi-million dollar estates.",
