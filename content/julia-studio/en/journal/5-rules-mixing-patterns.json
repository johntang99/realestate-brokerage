When patterns compete at the same scale, the eye doesn't know where to rest. Instead, pair a large-scale pattern (like a bold geometric rug) with a medium-scale pattern (like a textured pillow) and a small-scale pattern (like a subtle stripe on curtains).\n\n## 2. Anchor with a Solid\n\nNot every element needs a pattern. Solids give the eye a place to breathe. If you have three patterned items in a room, make sure there are at least two solid pieces — a sofa, a wall, a rug — to balance the composition.\n\n## 3. Connect Through Color\n\nSuccessful pattern mixing isn't random — there's always a color thread running through. Pull one or two colors from your dominant pattern and make sure they appear in your secondary patterns, even if just as accents.\n\n## 4. Mix Pattern Types\n\nDon't mix five florals. Instead, vary the type: a geometric with a floral, a stripe with an abstract, an organic print with a structured grid. Contrast in pattern type creates visual interest without chaos.\n\n## 5. Trust Your Eye\n\nThe final rule is intuition. Lay your samples out together. If they feel harmonious, they probably are. Design is ultimately about how a space feels — not how it follows rules.","bodyCn":"## 1. 变化尺度\n\n最常见的错误是混搭相似大小的图案。当图案以相同比例竞争时，眼睛不知道该停留在哪里。相反，将大尺度图案（如大胆几何地毯）与中等尺度图案（如纹理枕头）和小尺度图案（如窗帘上的细条纹）搭配。\n\n## 2. 用纯色锚定\n\n并非每个元素都需要图案。纯色给眼睛提供喘息的空间。如果房间里有三件带图案的物品，确保至少有两件纯色物品——沙发、墙壁、地毯——来平衡构图。","videoUrl":"","videoDuration":"","tags":["patterns","styling","how-to","design-tips"],"relatedPosts":["greenwich-estate-tour"],"relatedProducts":["woven-throw-blanket"],"seo":{"title":"5 Rules for Mixing Patterns Like a Designer — Julia Studio Journal","description":"Learn the designer rules for mixing patterns in interior design.
