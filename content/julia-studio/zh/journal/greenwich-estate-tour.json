That's the design challenge that energizes us most — spaces that are genuinely livable.\n\n## The Architecture\n\nThe house itself is a 1920s Colonial Revival — generous proportions, original moldings, and excellent bones. Our job was not to modernize it, but to refresh it. We stripped layers of dated renovation work and restored the home to its structural honesty, then built from there.\n\n## Material Palette\n\nWhite oak floors throughout. Italian Calacatta marble in the kitchen and primary bath. Custom millwork painted in a warm off-white (not stark white — there's a difference). Brass hardware, aged to a softer tone.\n\n## The Result\n\nThe Hendersons moved in eight months after we began. They sent us a photo from the first morning: children at the kitchen table, coffee on the counter, morning light through the windows they'd always dreamed of. That's the work.","bodyCn":"## 设计要求\n\n当Henderson一家第一次联系我们时，他们有一个清晰的愿景：一个可以举办20人正式晚宴、同时也能在周二早晨容纳三个孩子和一只狗的家。这是最激励我们的设计挑战——真正宜居的空间。","videoUrl":"","videoDuration":"","tags":["project-tour","residential","greenwich","transitional"],"relatedPosts":["5-rules-mixing-patterns"],"relatedProducts":["marin-console-table","aria-pendant-light"],"seo":{"title":"Inside the Greenwich Estate: A Project Tour — Julia Studio Journal","description":"A behind-the-scenes look at our Greenwich Estate project — how we balanced grandeur with family-friendly warmth."}}
