  "body": "## Market Summary\n\nFebruary 2026 continues the pattern established throughout late 2025: strong buyer demand meeting compressed supply. The result is a market that firmly favors sellers — but only those who price and present their homes correctly.\n\n## Price Trends\n\nThe median sale price of $875,000 represents a 6.2% year-over-year increase. Luxury properties ($2M+) saw the strongest appreciation at 8.1%, driven by continued demand from financial sector professionals and international buyers.\n\n## Inventory Analysis\n\nWith only 342 active listings across Westchester, buyers face intense competition for quality homes. Well-prepared, move-in-ready properties in top school districts are typically seeing 3-8 offers within the first weekend.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe spring market (March-June) will be the most competitive window of 2026. Buyers who are pre-approved and working with an experienced local agent will have the clearest advantage.",
