  "body": "# First-Time Buyer's Complete Guide to Westchester County\n\nBuying your first home is exciting, intimidating, and one of the most consequential financial decisions you'll make. In Westchester County — where median prices exceed $875,000 and competitive bidding situations are common — going in prepared isn't optional.\n\nThis guide covers everything you need to know.\n\n## Step 1: Get Pre-Approved (Not Pre-Qualified)\n\nThere is a critical difference. Pre-qualification is a 5-minute estimate. Pre-approval means a lender has reviewed your income, credit, assets, and debt — and issued a commitment letter. In Westchester's competitive market, sellers routinely reject offers without a pre-approval letter.\n\nYour pre-approval determines your price range. Do this before falling in love with any specific home.\n\n## Step 2: Define Your Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves\n\nBe brutally honest with yourself about the difference. In Westchester, the combination of school district + commute time + price point will determine your neighborhood — and those three variables often create tradeoffs.\n\nThe towns with the highest-rated school districts (Scarsdale, Bronxville, Ardsley) carry price premiums. Towns with slightly lower-ranked but still excellent schools (Dobbs Ferry, Tarrytown) offer meaningfully better value.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the True Cost of Homeownership\n\nYour monthly payment is more than your mortgage. In Westchester, factor in:\n\n- **Property taxes:** Among the highest in the nation — $8,000-$40,000+ per year depending on town and assessment\n- **Homeowner's insurance:** $1,500-$3,500/year for most single-family homes\n- **Maintenance reserve:** Budget 1-2% of home value annually\n- **HOA fees:** $200-$600/month if applicable (condos and some townhomes)\n\n## Step 4: Work With a Local Expert\n\nWestchester County has 43 municipalities, each with its own tax structure, school district boundaries, zoning quirks, and market dynamics. An agent who primarily works in Manhattan or New Jersey doesn't have this knowledge. Work with someone who lives and breathes Westchester.\n\n## Step 5: Move Decisively When You Find the Right Home\n\nIn 2025-2026, well-priced homes in good condition were receiving offers within 48-72 hours of listing. You may have one or two chances to see a home before offers are due. Have your pre-approval ready, know your numbers, and be prepared to decide quickly.\n\nHave questions?
