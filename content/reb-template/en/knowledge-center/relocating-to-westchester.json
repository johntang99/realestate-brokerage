  "body": "# Why Relocating Professionals Choose Westchester County\n\nEvery year, thousands of families trade Manhattan apartments for Westchester homes. The reasons are predictable: more space, better schools, a yard, quiet evenings. What surprises most newcomers is what they didn't expect — that the quality of life in Westchester exceeds what they imagined before they moved.\n\n## The Commute Is Better Than You Think\n\nThe Metro-North Railroad is genuinely excellent. Scarsdale to Grand Central: 33 minutes. Larchmont: 37 minutes. Dobbs Ferry: 45 minutes. You read on your commute, you arrive at a real train station (not a subway platform), and you walk out onto 42nd Street. It's a better commute than many Manhattan neighborhoods to Midtown.\n\n## The Space Calculus\n\nA family in a 2-bedroom Manhattan apartment for $4,500/month is spending $54,000/year to be cramped. For a similar monthly payment in Westchester (mortgage + taxes), that same family can live in a 4-bedroom, 2.5-bath colonial with a yard, a garage, and public schools that are genuinely competitive with private options.\n\n## Schools That Change the Equation\n\nWestchester's top school districts — Scarsdale, Bronxville, Edgemont, Ardsley — routinely send 98%+ of graduates to four-year colleges, including Ivy League institutions. For families who would otherwise be paying $45,000-$60,000/year per child for Manhattan private school, the move to a top Westchester district can save $400,000-$800,000 over a child's K-12 education.\n\n## The Communities Are Real\n\nWestchester has genuine village centers — places where people walk to coffee shops, run into neighbors, and participate in local life. This is not a suburb of strip malls. It's a region of real communities.\n\n## What to Know Before You Move\n\n- Property taxes are real and significant. Budget them honestly from day one.\n- Cars are necessary for most households outside walking distance of a train station\n- Different towns have dramatically different feels — visit each before you decide\n- The spring market moves fast — start your search in February to be ready\n\nReady to explore?
