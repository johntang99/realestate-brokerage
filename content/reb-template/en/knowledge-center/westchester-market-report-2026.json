  "body": "# 2026 Westchester County Market Report\n\nWestchester County real estate entered 2026 with strong demand, compressed inventory, and continued price appreciation across all price points. After a turbulent few years of rate adjustments, the market has found a new equilibrium — and both buyers and sellers need to understand what that means.\n\n## Key Data Points — Q4 2025 vs Q4 2024\n\n- **Median sale price:** $875,000 (+6.2% YoY)\n- **Average days on market:** 24 days (-3 days YoY)\n- **Sale-to-list ratio:** 103.1% (up from 101.8%)\n- **Active inventory:** Down 14% from same period last year\n- **New listings:** Down 9% — sellers still hesitant due to rate lock-in effect\n\n## What This Means for Buyers\n\nIf you're looking to buy in 2026, the key insight is this: well-priced homes in desirable school districts are still moving in days, not weeks. Pre-approval is not optional — it's your entry ticket to the market.\n\nThe silver lining: with 30-year rates stabilizing in the 6.5-7% range, the buying-vs-renting equation has shifted slightly back toward buying in many Westchester towns, particularly at the $600K-$900K price point.\n\n## What This Means for Sellers\n\n2026 is still a seller's market — but a disciplined one. Overpriced listings are sitting. Correctly priced listings are seeing multiple offers within the first weekend. The era of pricing 15% above market and expecting a buyer is over. Price at market or just below, prepare your home to show exceptionally well, and you'll be rewarded.\n\n## Neighborhood Highlights\n\n**Scarsdale:** Continued strength. Median $1.65M. Inventory at 5-year low.\n**Larchmont:** Strong demand from NYC relocators. Median $925K. 26-day average DOM.\n**Bronxville:** Trophy market. Median $2.1M. Properties priced right receiving multiple offers.\n**White Plains:** Best value in southern Westchester. Condo market particularly active.\n\n## Our Outlook for 2026\n\nWe expect continued modest appreciation (4-6%) with inventory slowly improving in the second half of the year as rate relief becomes more predictable. The spring market — March through June — will be the most competitive window of the year. Buyers who are ready to move quickly will have the best selection.\n\nQuestions about what this means for your specific situation? Contact our team for a personalized market analysis.",
