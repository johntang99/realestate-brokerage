## 1. Why Two Stages

Proload Express works because it was designed as an LTL freight authority site — not a medical site with different colors. The components (savings calculator, coverage map, testimonial wall, rate request form), the conversion funnel (visit → impressed → sign up → quote → customer), the content strategy (case studies, blog authority, price leadership messaging) — all of these were industry-specific design decisions made BEFORE implementation.

If you skip Stage A and jump to implementation, you get:

- A generic site that looks like every other template
- Missing industry-specific features that competitors have
- Content that doesn't speak to the target customer's pain points
- A conversion funnel that doesn't match how the industry buys
- Components inherited from the medical system instead of designed for the industry

**Stage A is where the site becomes special. Stage B is where it gets built.**

### Lessons from Previous Builds

| Build | What Went Right | What Could Improve |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Medical (System A) | Solid admin CMS, multi-site, bilingual | Admin was built alongside — good integration |
| Epoch Press (System C) | Frontend-first proved design before backend | Admin wiring was a large Phase 3 task |
| Proload Express (System E) | Premium, industry-specific, conversion-focused | Admin deferred to late phase caused back-and-forth |

The universal fix: **design the full site before coding, integrate admin into every build step.**

## 3. A1: Industry Deep Dive

**Objective:** Understand the industry so well that the site feels like it was built by an insider.

### 3.1 Competitor Analysis

Study 8-12 top competitors in the industry:

- Screenshot their home pages, key pages, forms, pricing pages
- Document: what they do well, what they do poorly, what's missing
- Note: page count, content depth, unique features, conversion methods
- Identify: what would make a visitor choose them vs others

**Competitor analysis template:**

| Competitor | URL | Strengths | Weaknesses | Unique Features | Conversion Method | Page Count |
|-----------|-----|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| [Name] | [URL] | | | | | |

### 3.2 Customer Research

Understand who visits and what they need:

- Who is the buyer? (title, company size, pain points, decision criteria)
- What are their top 3 questions when they land on a site?
- What makes them trust a company in this industry?
- What's their buying journey? (research → compare → contact → decide)
- What conversion action do they prefer? (form, phone, chat, signup, booking)

### 3.3 Industry-Specific Requirements

- Compliance/credentials that must be displayed (licenses, certifications, insurance)
- Industry terminology and jargon the site must use
- Trust signals specific to this industry
- Seasonal patterns or timing considerations
- Common objections and how to overcome them on the site

### 3.4 SEO Landscape

- Top keywords and search volume
- What types of content rank well in this industry
- Programmatic page opportunities (location, service, comparison)
- Content gap analysis: what competitors aren't covering

**Deliverable:** Industry Research Brief (3-5 pages)

---

## 4. A2: Brand Positioning & Differentiation

**Objective:** Define exactly why a visitor should choose this company over every competitor.

### 4.1 Core Positioning Statement

Format: "[Company] is the [superlative] [service] for [audience] because [reason]."

**Examples from BAAM builds:**
- Medical: "Dr. Huang Clinic is the premier Traditional Chinese Medicine practice in Flushing, combining 20+ years of expertise with personalized acupuncture care."
- Printing: "Epoch Press is the quality-first commercial printing partner for businesses nationwide, delivering newspaper, magazine, and book printing with competitive pricing."
- Logistics: "Proload Express is the most competitive LTL freight solution for US businesses because we leverage 200+ carriers to guarantee the lowest rates."

### 4.2 Five Pillars of Differentiation

Define 5 reasons someone should choose this company. For each pillar:

- What is the claim? (e.g., "Lowest prices")
- How does the site communicate it? (e.g., price comparison section, savings calculator)
- What evidence supports it? (e.g., "Average 23% savings", customer testimonials about cost)

### 4.3 Scale Perception Strategy

- What numbers communicate size? (customers, projects, years, employees, locations)
- What social proof is needed? (testimonial count, case study count, logos, awards)
- What volume of content signals authority? (blog posts, guides, resources)

### 4.4 Conversion Path

- Primary conversion: what is it? (quote request, booking, signup, phone call)
- Secondary conversion: what is it? (account creation, newsletter, download)
- What's the promise? ("Quote in 2 hours", "Free consultation", "See pricing instantly")
- What trust signals surround the conversion point?

**Deliverable:** Brand Positioning Document (2-3 pages)

---

## 5. A3: Site Architecture & Page Design

**Objective:** Design every page with its purpose, content, sections, and conversion role — before any code exists.

### 5.1 Page Design Template

For each page, define:

```
Page: [Name]
Route: /[path]
Purpose: [Why this page exists — what it does for the business]
Conversion role: [How this page drives leads — hook/educate/convince/convert/retain]
Target visitor: [Who lands on this page and what they're looking for]

Sections (in order):
1. [Section name] — [What it shows] — [Why it matters]
2. [Section name] — [What it shows] — [Why it matters]
...

Content requirements:
- [Specific content needed: stats, testimonials, case studies, etc.]
- [Media needed: photos, icons, videos, maps, etc.]

CTA strategy:
- Primary CTA: [label] → [destination]
- Secondary CTA: [label] → [destination]

SEO:
- Target keyword: [keyword]
- Title: [page title]
- Description: [meta description]
```

### 5.2 Page Tiers

**Tier 1 — Core (must-have at launch):**
- Home (the hook — first impression, scale, differentiation)
- Services / What We Do (detailed service breakdown)
- Why Us / Differentiator (the convincer — comparison, proof, calculator)
- About (trust — company story, team, credentials, scale numbers)
- Primary Conversion Page (quote/booking/contact form)
- Contact (backup conversion — phone, email, address)

**Tier 2 — Authority & Social Proof:**
- Case Studies / Portfolio / Projects (deep proof of results)
- Testimonials / Reviews (volume of social proof)
- Blog (thought leadership + SEO engine)
- Resources / Guides (educational content + SEO)
- FAQ (objection handling + SEO)

**Tier 3 — Specialized:**
- Industry-specific pages (whatever the industry demands)
- Account signup / Client portal
- Tracking / Status page
- Careers
- Partners / Vendors

**Tier 4 — Programmatic SEO:**
- Service × Location pages
- Service × Industry pages
- Route / Comparison / Guide pages

**Deliverable:** Complete Page Design Document — every page fully designed with sections, content, CTAs, and purpose.

---

## 6. A4: Component Inventory & Unique Features

**Objective:** Identify which components are industry-standard reuse and which are UNIQUE to this industry.

### 6.1 Component Classification

| Component | Industry-Specific? | Description | Comparable Medical Component |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Hero | Reuse (adapt) | Bold hero with CTA | Same pattern, different content |
| Service Cards | Reuse (adapt) | Service type grid | Similar to Services section |
| Stats Counter | Reuse (adapt) | Animated numbers | Similar to Stats section |
| Process Timeline | Reuse (adapt) | How-it-works steps | Similar to HowItWorks |
| CTA Banner | Reuse (adapt) | Conversion banner | Same pattern |
| FAQ Accordion | Reuse (adapt) | Expandable Q&A | Same pattern |
| Testimonials | Reuse (adapt) | Customer quotes | Similar but often different layout |
| [Industry NEW] | NEW | [Describe] | No equivalent |

### 6.2 New Component Requirements

For each NEW component, define:

- What does it do?
- Why does this industry need it?
- What data does it consume? (JSON shape)
- What are the variant options?
- What competitor sites have a good version to reference?

**Examples of industry-specific NEW components from previous builds:**

| Industry | NEW Components |
|----------|---------------|
| Printing | ProductSpecBlock, PriceTierTable, QuoteForm, FileUploadGuide, EquipmentShowcase |
| Logistics | CoverageMap, RateRequestForm, SavingsCalculator, TransitTimeTable, ComparisonTable, TrustLogoTicker, TestimonialWall, SignUpForm |
| Restaurant | MenuDisplay, OnlineOrderForm, ReservationWidget, PhotoGallery, ChefProfile |
| Legal | PracticeAreaCards, CaseResultsTicker, ConsultationForm, AttorneyProfiles |

**Deliverable:** Component Inventory with clear NEW vs REUSE classification.

## 7. A5: Visual Design Direction

**Objective:** Define the visual identity before any code.

### 7.1 Color Palette

- Primary color and why (industry association or brand emotion)
- Secondary/accent color and why
- Supporting colors (success, warning, neutral, dark sections, light sections)
- Color psychology rationale for this industry

**Examples from BAAM builds:**

| System | Primary | Secondary | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Medical | Earth green (#2D5016) | Warm gold (#8B7355) | Natural, healing, traditional |
| Printing | Deep navy (#0F1B2D) | Warm gold (#B8860B) | Premium, sophisticated, craftsmanship |
| Logistics | Deep navy (#0A2463) | Vibrant orange (#FF6B35) | Authority/trust + energy/urgency |

### 7.2 Typography

- Font family and why (modern, traditional, technical, friendly)
- Weight hierarchy (headlines, subheads, body, captions)
- Size scale (display, heading, subheading, body, small)

### 7.3 Photography & Visual Style

- What images does this industry need? (equipment, people, locations, products, processes)
- Stock photo direction (realistic, professional, diverse, action-oriented)
- Image treatment (dark overlays, bright and clean, moody, high-contrast)

### 7.4 Layout Principles

- Dense vs spacious (busy professionals need dense info; luxury brands need space)
- Dark vs light dominant (authority/premium vs clean/approachable)
- Animation level (minimal for professional, moderate for modern tech-forward)

### 7.5 Competitor Visual Comparison

- What do top competitors look like?
- How should this site feel different?
- What visual cues signal industry authority?

### 7.6 Design Reference Sites

List 3-5 sites (from any industry) that capture the right feel, with what specifically to reference from each.

**Deliverable:** Visual Design Brief

---

## 8. A6: Content Strategy & Conversion Funnel

**Objective:** Plan the content that makes the site an authority and drives conversions.

### 8.1 Launch Content Requirements

- How many case studies? (target: 6-12 for credibility)
- How many blog posts? (target: 6-10 for authority signal)
- What resource/guide pages? (industry-specific educational content)

### 8.2 Conversion Funnel Map

```
Awareness: Blog post / SEO page / Ad
   ↓
Interest: Home page / Services page / Why Us page
   ↓
Consideration: Case Studies / Testimonials / Comparison page
   ↓
Decision: Quote form / Pricing / Signup

## 9. Stage A Output Summary

At the end of Stage A, you have a complete blueprint:

| Artifact | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Industry Research Brief** | Competitors, customers, requirements, SEO landscape |
| **Brand Positioning Document** | Positioning, 5 pillars, scale strategy, conversion path |
| **Page Design Document** | Every page: purpose, sections, content, CTAs, SEO |
| **Component Inventory** | NEW vs REUSE, data requirements, variant options |
| **Visual Design Brief** | Colors, typography, photography, layout, references |
| **Content Strategy & Funnel** | Launch content, funnel map, CTA strategy, post-launch plan |

**This blueprint is what makes the Cursor prompts precise and the final site premium.**

Without this blueprint, Cursor guesses. With it, Cursor executes.

**Stage A is done with Claude (strategic thinking). Stage B is done with Cursor (code execution).**

### Stage A Acceptance Gates

Stage B must NOT begin until ALL gates pass. This prevents the most common failure: starting to build before the design is complete.

| Gate | Criteria | Pass/Fail |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **A-Gate-1: Page Map** | Every launch page has: route, purpose, conversion role, section list, CTA strategy, SEO target. No TBD sections. | |
| **A-Gate-2: Conversion Funnel** | Full funnel mapped (Awareness → Action). Primary + secondary CTA defined per page. CTA placement approved. | |
| **A-Gate-3: Content Contracts** | JSON schema defined for 100% of launch pages. All section types have typed fields. No "placeholder shape" sections. | |
| **A-Gate-4: Variant Registry** | Every section that supports variants has: variant IDs, descriptions, and confirmed frontend rendering plan. | |
| **A-Gate-5: Content Minimums** | Confirmed counts: testimonials (min 20), case studies (min 6), blog posts (min 6), FAQ items (min 20). Content either exists or has creation plan with dates. | |
| **A-Gate-6: Visual Direction** | Color palette, typography, photography style, layout principles documented. At least 3 reference sites identified. | |
| **A-Gate-7: Component Inventory** | Every component classified NEW vs REUSE. NEW components have: data shape, variant options, competitor reference. | |

**Rule: If any gate is "Fail," resolve it before writing code. No exceptions.**

## 10. Stage B Overview & Methodology

**Duration:** 5 weeks
**Tool:** Cursor AI (Sonnet 4.6 Agent) for code execution
**Input:** Stage A blueprint (all 6 artifacts)

### 10.1 Core Methodology: Contract-First + Admin Done-Gate

Two principles govern all of Stage B:

**Contract-First:** Define JSON schema + variants + form fields BEFORE coding each page. The content contract (from Stage A's Page Design Document) is translated into a concrete JSON shape, variant registry entries, and admin form field definitions at the start of Phase 0 — not discovered during implementation.

**Admin Done-Gate:** A page is only "done" when it passes all three steps:

1. **BUILD** — Page UI coded, consuming data from DB-first content loader, variant-aware, theme-token colors only
2. **WIRE** — Admin Form mode shows correct fields, JSON mode shows full contract, variant dropdown present
3. **VERIFY** — Roundtrip test passes: edit in admin Form mode → save → check frontend updated; switch variant → save → check layout changed; edit in JSON mode → save → confirm Form mode synced

### 10.2 Architecture Principles

1. **DB-First Always:** Frontend reads from Supabase `content_entries`. Local JSON is development fallback only.
2. **Theme Tokens Only:** No hardcoded hex colors in page components. Everything through `theme.json` CSS variables.
3. **Editor Boundaries:** Content Editor for pages and site settings. Blog Posts Editor for blog entries. No overlap.
4. **Site-Scoped Isolation:** Content, media, and settings scoped by `site_id`. One codebase, clean tenant separation.
5. **Media via Supabase Storage:** All images through storage bucket with provider import (Unsplash/Pexels). No local filesystem in production.

### 10.3 Phase Overview

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Admin Integration |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Phase 0** | Day 1-3 | Infrastructure + Content Contracts | Define ALL contracts, variants, form fields |
| **Phase 1** | Week 1-2 | Core Pages (frontend + admin wiring) | Build → Wire → Verify per page |
| **Phase 2** | Week 3 | Conversion + Content + Polish | Same pattern for remaining pages |
| **Phase 3** | Week 4 | Admin Hardening + SEO | Gap closure + programmatic pages |
| **Phase 3.5** | 1-2 days | Admin Certification SOP | One-pass checklist + fix sweep before launch |
| **Phase 4** | Week 5 | QA + Deploy | Acceptance testing + production launch |

---

## 11. Phase 0: Infrastructure + Content Contracts

**Duration:** Day 1-3
**Input:** All 6 Stage A artifacts

### 11.1 Project Setup (Prompt 0A)

1. Duplicate medical codebase OR clean BAAM starter template
2. Strip previous industry-specific code:
   - Remove old content directories
   - Remove industry-specific section components
   - Remove booking system (if not needed for this industry)
   - Remove unused locale content (if English-only)
3. Keep intact:
   - Admin CMS (ContentEditor, SiteSettings, Media, Variants, Users, Sites)
   - Content loading system (`lib/content.ts`, `lib/contentDb.ts`)
   - Media system (upload, list, delete, provider search/import, URL normalization)
   - Theme system (`theme.json` → CSS variables)
   - Domain routing middleware
   - Import/export system
   - Auth and RBAC
4. Create new Supabase project (fully isolated — never reuse another project's DB)
5. Run schema SQL in order:
   - Admin + content tables
   - RLS policies
6. Create storage bucket (`media`)
7. Set all environment variables (Supabase, JWT, Resend, Unsplash, Pexels)
8. Configure site entry in `_sites.json`
9. Set up local domain alias

### 11.2 Theme Setup (Prompt 0B)

Implement the Visual Design Brief from Stage A:

1. Create `theme.json` with industry color palette, typography, font configuration
2. Update Tailwind config to extend with industry colors
3. Import fonts via `next/font`
4. Populate global settings files:
   - `site.json` — company info, contact, tagline
   - `header.json` — nav items, CTA button, logo config
   - `footer.json` — columns, links, compliance info
   - `seo.json` — default title template, meta description
   - `navigation.json` — full nav structure

### 11.3 Content Contracts (THE KEY STEP — Prompt 0C)

**Before writing any page code, define the complete content model.**

Translate the Page Design Document from Stage A into three concrete artifacts:

**Artifact 1 — Page Inventory & Content Contract Map**

| Page | Route | Content Path | Sections | Has Layout? | Has Collection? |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Home | / | pages/home.json | hero, valueProposition, services, testimonials, howItWorks, caseStudies, coverage, blog, cta | Yes | No |
| Services | /services | pages/services.json | hero, serviceDetails, accessorials, industries, cta | Yes | No |
| Blog Hub | /blog | pages/blog.json | hero, featured, grid, newsletter, cta | Yes | Collection: blog/*.json |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Artifact 2 — Section Contract + Variant + Form Field Definition**

For EVERY section type used across the site:

```
## Section: hero

### Variants:
- centered: centered text, full-width background
- split-image: text left, image right
- video-bg: text overlay on video background
- animated-stats: text + animated stat counters

### JSON Contract:
{
  "hero": {
    "variant": "animated-stats",
    "headline": "string (required)",
    "subline": "string (required)",
    "stats": [{ "value": "string", "label": "string" }],
    "ctaPrimary": { "label": "string", "href": "string" },
    "ctaSecondary": { "label": "string", "href": "string" },
    "backgroundImage": "string (url, optional)"
  }
}

### Form Fields:
- headline: text, required
- subline: textarea, required
- variant: select [centered, split-image, video-bg, animated-stats]
- stats: array → { value: text, label: text }
- ctaPrimary.label: text; ctaPrimary.href: text
- backgroundImage: image picker
```

**Artifact 3 — Global Settings Contract**

Exact JSON shape for: site.json, header.json, footer.json, seo.json, theme.json, navigation.json.

Implementation note: for clone-friendly admin scaling, follow [18.7 Site-Clone Ready Method (ContentEditor Modular Pattern)](#187-site-clone-ready-method-contenteditor-modular-pattern).

### 11.4 Seed Baseline Content (Prompt 0D)

1. Create ALL JSON files with realistic placeholder content matching contracts
2. Create ALL `.layout.json` files defining section order per page
3. Seed everything into Supabase `content_entries` via seed script
4. Register all variant definitions in admin Variants panel
5. Create admin form field definitions for all sections

### 11.5 Phase 0 Done-Gate

- [ ] App boots without errors
- [ ] Admin login works
- [ ] ALL content contracts defined (Artifacts 1-3 complete)
- [ ] ALL JSON files seeded in Supabase `content_entries`
- [ ] Content Editor shows all page files with form panels
- [ ] Variant dropdowns populated for all applicable sections
- [ ] Theme variables injected into CSS
- [ ] Media upload works (Supabase Storage bucket active)
- [ ] Git committed and tagged

---

## 12. Phase 1: Core Pages — Build / Wire / Verify

**Duration:** Week 1-2
**Method:** One Cursor conversation per page. Each page follows the Build → Wire → Verify cycle.

### 12.1 Cursor Prompt Structure

Every Phase 1-2 Cursor prompt should follow this template:

```
Build the [Page Name] page at /[route].

**Content source:**
This page loads from content path: pages/[slug].json
Use loadPageContent() to fetch from Supabase (DB-first, file fallback).
Layout controlled by pages/[slug].layout.json

**Sections (in order):**
1. [Section] — [Description with all fields from contract]
2. [Section] — [Description]
...

**Design requirements:**
- Colors: use theme CSS variables (--color-primary, --color-secondary, etc.)
- Typography: use theme font variables
- NO hardcoded hex colors in any component

**Variant support:**
- [Section] supports variants: [list]
- Render using switch/conditional on section.variant field

**After building, verify (Admin Done-Gate):**
- Page renders correctly from DB content
- Edit content in admin Form mode → save → frontend updated
- Switch variant in admin → save → layout changes
- Edit in JSON mode → save → Form mode synced
- Change section order in layout.json → save → render order changes

Reference @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and @content-contracts/[page].json
```

### 12.2 Phase 1 Build Order

| # | Prompt | Page | Key Sections | Complexity |
|---|--------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Home Page | / | Hero, value proposition, services, testimonials, process, case study highlight, coverage teaser, blog preview, CTA | High — most sections, sets design system |
| 2 | Header + Footer | Layout | Nav, CTA button, logo, columns, compliance info | Medium — shared components |
| 3 | Services / What We Do | /services | Hero, service details, additional services, industries served, CTA | Medium |
| 4 | Why Us / Differentiator | /why-us | Hero, value props, comparison table, calculator/interactive, testimonials, awards, CTA | High — interactive elements |
| 5 | About | /about | Hero, company story, stats, team, values, certifications, CTA | Medium |
| 6 | Coverage / Locations | /coverage | Hero, map/regions, transit/details, key items, CTA | Medium-High — map component |

### 12.3 Build → Wire → Verify Checklist (per page)

| Check | Description | Pass? |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Frontend renders | Page loads and displays correctly from DB content | |
| Form edit | Edit a field in admin Form mode → save → frontend shows change | |
| JSON edit | Edit in JSON tab → save → Form mode synced | |
| Variant switch | Change variant in admin → save → layout visually changes | |
| Layout reorder | Change section order in .layout.json → save → page reorders | |
| Theme compliance | No hardcoded hex — all colors from theme tokens | |
| Media fields | Image picker works for hero/media fields | |

### 12.4 Phase 1 Done-Gate

- [ ] 6-8 core pages built and rendering from DB content
- [ ] ALL pages editable in admin Content Editor (Form + JSON mode)
- [ ] Variant switching works on all sections that support variants
- [ ] Layout reordering works on all pages
- [ ] Theme tokens used everywhere (no hardcoded colors)
- [ ] Header and Footer render from global settings (header.json, footer.json)
- [ ] Design system locked: colors, typography, spacing, animation patterns consistent
- [ ] **SEO baseline per page:** unique title, meta description, canonical URL, OG tags (shift-left — don't defer all SEO to Phase 3)
- [ ] Git tagged: `v0.1-core-pages`

---

## 13. Phase 2: Conversion + Content Pages + Polish

**Duration:** Week 3
**Method:** Same Build → Wire → Verify for all remaining pages.

### 13.1 Phase 2 Build Order

| 12 | Resources / Guides | /resources | Industry educational content, glossary, downloadable templates |
| 13 | Contact | /contact | Form, direct info, map, quick action cards |
| 14 | FAQ | /faq | Accordion with categories, 25+ questions |
| 15 | Responsive Polish | All pages | Mobile/tablet/desktop, performance, accessibility |

### 13.2 Blog Editor Boundary

This is critical to enforce correctly:

- **Blog posts** → managed in `Admin > Blog Posts` editor (create/edit/delete)
- **Blog hub page settings** (hero, featured config, CTA) → managed in `Content Editor` at `pages/blog.json`
- **No blog entries should appear in Content Editor**
- **No page settings should appear in Blog Posts Editor**

Verify: creating a blog post in Blog Posts Editor → it appears on /blog hub and /blog/[slug].

### 13.3 Form Submission Setup

For quote/contact/signup forms:

1. Form validation with inline error messages
2. Loading state on submit button
3. Submission via Supabase Edge Function → Resend email notification
4. Store submissions in Supabase table (e.g., `quote_requests`)
5. Confirmation screen with next steps and secondary CTA
6. Test: submit form → email arrives → entry stored in DB

### 13.4 Responsive Polish Checklist

- Mobile (< 768px): hamburger nav, single column, thumb-friendly CTAs (44px+), clickable phone numbers
- Tablet (768-1024px): 2-column where appropriate
- Desktop (1024px+): max-width 1280px, trust sidebars on conversion pages
- No horizontal overflow anywhere
- All interactive elements have hover/focus states
- WCAG AA color contrast verified (especially accent colors on white)
- Semantic HTML throughout

### 13.5 Phase 2 Done-Gate

- [ ] ALL pages built and admin-editable (Form + JSON mode)
- [ ] Blog posts manageable through Blog Posts Editor (create/edit/delete)
- [ ] Case studies / portfolio manageable through Content Editor

## 14. Phase 3: Admin Hardening + SEO

**Duration:** Week 4
**Note:** Phase 3 is NOT first-time admin wiring. If Phase 1-2 followed the Build → Wire → Verify pattern, this phase should be gap closure and SEO expansion — not a major rework.

### 14.1 Admin Gap Audit

Run through every public route and check:

| Route | Content in DB? | Form fields complete? | JSON synced? | Variant works? | Theme tokens? | Media fields? | Layout.json? | PASS? |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| / | | | | | | | | |
| /services | | | | | | | | |
| ... | | | | | | | | |

Fix any gaps found. Target: 100% coverage.
When closing admin gaps, keep/extend the modular editor pattern from [18.7 Site-Clone Ready Method (ContentEditor Modular Pattern)](#187-site-clone-ready-method-contenteditor-modular-pattern).

### 14.2 Programmatic SEO Pages

Build dynamic page templates from Stage A's SEO landscape research:

**Service × Location Pages:**
- Dynamic route: `/[service]/[location]/page.tsx`
- Location data file with cities, states, regions
- Each page: unique H1, intro paragraphs, local relevance, service details, testimonial, CTA
- `generateStaticParams()` for all combinations
- ISR revalidation: 86400s (24 hours)
- Unique meta title and description per page

**Route / Industry / Comparison Pages** (if applicable):
- Separate dynamic routes for each type
- Content from data files or content_entries
- Unique content per page (not thin duplicates)

**Internal Linking:**
- Each programmatic page links to: main service page, nearby locations, related services
- Add "Serving [Region]" sections with cross-links

### 14.3 Schema.org Structured Data

Create utility at `/lib/schema.ts` with helpers:

| Page Type | Schema |
|-----------|--------|
| Site-wide | LocalBusiness, Organization |
| Service pages | Service, Offer |
| Blog posts | BlogPosting, BreadcrumbList |
| FAQ | FAQPage |
| Case studies | Article |
| Location pages | Service with areaServed |
| Testimonials | AggregateRating |

Implement via Next.js metadata API + JSON-LD script tags.

### 14.4 Technical SEO

- **Sitemap.xml** — Dynamic, includes all URLs (core + blog + case studies + programmatic)
- **Robots.txt** — Allow all public, disallow /admin/ and /api/admin/
- **IndexNow** — Integration for Bing/Yandex notification on content publish
- **Canonical URLs** — On all pages, especially programmatic
- **OG tags + Twitter cards** — Every page with appropriate images

### 14.5 Performance Optimization

- **Images:** next/image everywhere, priority on hero, lazy load below-fold, WebP
- **Fonts:** next/font, font-display: swap, subset to latin
- **JavaScript:** Server-render static content, dynamic import interactive components
- **Caching:** ISR 3600s core pages, 86400s programmatic, dynamic for forms
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1
- **Lighthouse audit:** Run on Home, Service page, Conversion page, Blog post, Location page — all scores > 90

### 14.6 Phase 3 Done-Gate

- [ ] Admin gap matrix: 100% coverage (every page editable)
- [ ] Programmatic SEO pages built and generating static paths
- [ ] Schema.org validates on key pages (Rich Results Test)
- [ ] Sitemap includes all URLs (count verified)
- [ ] Lighthouse scores > 90 on all categories
- [ ] IndexNow integration working
- [ ] Canonical URLs correct on all pages
- [ ] Git tagged: `v0.3-launch-ready`

## 16. Phase 5: 12-Month Business Growth Plan

### 16.1 Month 1-2: Launch Foundation

**Content velocity:**
- Publish 8-10 blog posts (launch burst — signals active, authoritative site)
- Collect first 5 real testimonials from actual customers
- Create first 2 real case studies with verified metrics
- Expand programmatic pages to 100+

**Monitoring setup:**
- Vercel Analytics or GA4 enabled
- Google Search Console monitored weekly
- Track: conversions (form submissions, signups), phone calls, organic traffic, pages indexed

**Weekly rhythm:**

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Mon | Check weekend conversions, plan week's content |
| Tue | Publish blog post |
| Wed | Outreach for testimonials and case studies |
| Thu | Publish blog post |
| Fri | Weekly metrics review, publish blog post if ready |

**Monthly targets:**
- 8-10 blog posts published
- 5+ testimonials collected
- 2+ case studies published
- 100+ programmatic pages live
- Google Search Console: pages beginning to index

### 16.2 Month 3-4: Optimization

**SEO analysis:**
- Which pages are ranking? Double down with related content.
- Which aren't? Improve content, add internal links, re-submit.
- Which keywords get impressions but low clicks? Optimize titles and descriptions.
- Add 30-50 more programmatic pages based on Search Console data.

**Conversion optimization:**
- Review form completion rates — simplify if drop-off is high
- Test CTA copy variations (manual A/B: change monthly, compare results)
- Review bounce rates: Home (target <50%), Conversion page (target <40%)
- Consider: live chat widget if phone/form conversion is low

**Monthly targets:**
- 20+ blog posts total
- 10+ testimonials total
- 5+ case studies total
- 150+ programmatic pages
- Organic traffic: measurable and growing

### 16.3 Month 5-6: Scaling

**Paid acquisition (if organic is growing):**
- Google Ads: target high-intent keywords (e.g., "[industry] quotes near me")
- LinkedIn Ads: target decision-makers in relevant industries (B2B)
- Retargeting: show ads to site visitors who didn't convert
- Budget: start small ($500-1000/month), measure cost-per-lead

**Content authority:**
- Guest posts on industry publications
- Social media presence (LinkedIn primary for B2B, Instagram for visual industries)
- Consider: industry report or whitepaper for lead generation
- Consider: webinar or video content

**Operational improvements:**
- Automate quote/lead response (if volume justifies)
- CRM integration for lead tracking
- Email nurture sequence for signups who haven't converted yet

### 16.4 Month 7-9: Compounding

**By now you should have:**
- 50+ blog posts
- 20+ testimonials
- 10+ case studies
- 200+ total pages (including programmatic)
- Steady organic traffic growth
- Predictable conversion rate

**Focus on:**
- Highest-converting pages → create more similar content
- Lowest-performing pages → update, consolidate, or remove
- Customer retention: check-in emails, loyalty incentives, upsell
- Referral program: incentivize existing customers to refer new business
- Seasonal content: plan for industry-specific peaks

### 16.5 Month 10-12: BAAM Template Extraction

**Template creation:**
1. Document which components, layouts, and content patterns worked best
2. Extract reusable template: same admin backend, templatized frontend
3. Register as BAAM System [X] for this industry
4. Pricing: $20/month per client site

**New client onboarding SOP:**
1. Clone template repository
2. Create new Supabase project (isolated)
3. Run schema SQL + create storage bucket
4. Set environment variables
5. Import baseline content (with `missing` mode)
6. Customize: company info, colors, images, content through admin CMS
7. Configure domain, deploy to Vercel
8. Train client on admin CMS basics
9. Go live

### 16.6 Growth Targets by Month 12

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Organic monthly traffic | 2,000-5,000 visits |
| Monthly conversions (quotes/signups) | 50-100 |
| Blog posts published | 80+ |
| Case studies | 15+ |
| Testimonials displayed | 50+ |
| Programmatic pages | 200+ |
| Total indexed pages | 300+ |
| BAAM template clients | 3-5 |

---

## 17. Admin Content Coverage SOP

### Quick Checklist (for any BAAM industry site)

1. Audit all routes → map to content files → identify gaps
2. Build complete page contracts + layout contracts (Phase 0)
3. Wire frontend to DB-first content loaders (Phase 1-2)
4. Enforce editor boundaries: Content Editor for pages/settings, Blog Posts Editor for blog entries
5. Complete Form mode fields per page (Phase 1-2 done-gates)
6. Activate section variants with real frontend rendering
7. Tokenize theme usage — remove all hardcoded color literals
8. Run QA matrix and sign-off (Phase 4)

### Editor Boundaries

| Editor | Manages | Does NOT Manage |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Content Editor | Page content (pages/*.json), page layouts (*.layout.json), site settings (site.json, header.json, footer.json, seo.json, navigation.json, theme.json) | Blog entries |
| Blog Posts Editor | Blog entries (blog/*.json) — create, edit, delete | Page content, site settings |

### Protected Files (non-deletable)

- theme.json
- site.json
- navigation.json
- header.json
- footer.json
- seo.json

---

## 18. Admin Architecture: Collection Editors

### 18.1 The Problem

As BAAM grows, the Content Editor file list becomes unwieldy. Looking at the Proload Express admin, the Content panel lists: About, About.Layout, Blog, Blog.Layout, Case Studies, Case Studies.Layout, Compare, Contact, Contact.Layout, Coverage... and continues. Every page, layout, and collection item appears in one flat list.

This is manageable with 5 pages. It's painful with 12. It's unusable with 20+ pages and dozens of case studies, testimonials, and FAQ items.

### 18.2 The Solution: Dedicated Collection Editors

Extend the Blog Posts pattern to other collection types. Each high-volume content type gets its own dedicated sidebar nav item with purpose-built UI.

**Admin sidebar navigation (target architecture):**

```
Admin Dashboard
├── Sites
├── Site Settings
├── Content              ← Page content ONLY (pages/*.json, *.layout.json, site settings)
├── Blog Posts           ← Already done. Blog entries only (blog/*.json)
├── Case Studies         ← NEW. case-studies/*.json, purpose-built form
├── Testimonials         ← NEW. Dedicated list/edit UI for testimonials array
├── FAQ                  ← NEW. Dedicated list/edit UI for FAQ items
├── [Industry-Specific]  ← Optional: Bookings, Products, Menu Items, etc.
├── Media
├── Components
├── Variants
├── Users
├── Settings
```

### 18.3 What Each Editor Manages

| Editor | Content Scope | CRUD | Purpose-Built Features |
|--------|--------------|------|----------------------|
| **Content** | pages/*.json, *.layout.json, globals (site, header, footer, seo, nav, theme) | Edit only (no create/delete for protected files) | Form + JSON tabs, variant selector, layout editor |
| **Blog Posts** | blog/*.json | Create, Edit, Duplicate, Delete | Title/slug auto-generation, category picker, publish date, featured toggle, rich text |
| **Case Studies** | case-studies/*.json | Create, Edit, Duplicate, Delete | Industry picker, metrics fields, results array, client quote, related case studies |
| **Testimonials** | testimonials.json (array items) | Add, Edit, Remove, Reorder | Star rating, industry tag, featured toggle, drag-to-reorder |
| **FAQ** | faq-items.json (array items) OR pages/faq.json subsection | Add, Edit, Remove, Reorder | Category assignment, drag-to-reorder, expand/collapse preview |

### 18.4 ContentEditor.tsx Refactoring

The current ContentEditor.tsx is too large. Refactor into:

```
components/admin/
├── ContentEditor/
│   ├── index.tsx              ← Orchestrator (file list + active editor)
│   ├── FileList.tsx           ← Left panel: filtered file list
│   ├── FormEditor.tsx         ← Form mode rendering
│   ├── JsonEditor.tsx         ← JSON mode rendering
│   ├── LayoutEditor.tsx       ← Layout section ordering
│   └── VariantSelector.tsx    ← Variant dropdown per section
├── BlogPostsEditor/
│   ├── index.tsx              ← Blog list + active post editor
│   ├── PostList.tsx           ← Left panel: post list with status/date
│   ├── PostForm.tsx           ← Blog-specific form fields
│   └── PostPreview.tsx        ← Live preview
├── CaseStudiesEditor/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── StudyList.tsx
│   └── StudyForm.tsx
├── TestimonialsEditor/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── TestimonialForm.tsx
├── FaqEditor/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── FaqItemForm.tsx
```

**Key principles:**
- ContentEditor shrinks by extracting sub-components and removing collection logic
- Each collection editor is self-contained with its own list, form, and CRUD operations
- Shared utilities (save, load, media picker, variant selector) remain in common lib
- File filter in Content Editor excludes blog/*, case-studies/*, and any collection-managed paths

### 18.5 Implementation Priority

| Priority | Editor | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| ✅ Done | Blog Posts | — | Blog management separated |
| High | ContentEditor refactor | 2-3 days | Smaller file, better maintainability |
| High | Case Studies | 1-2 days | Frequent CRUD, industry-specific fields |
| Medium | Testimonials | 1 day | Array management with reorder |
| Medium | FAQ | 1 day | Array management with categories |
| Low | Industry-specific | As needed | Bookings (medical), Products (printing), etc. |

### 18.6 Impact on Phase Template

In the BAAM phase template, Phase 0 should now include:

- Identify which content types need dedicated editors (blog is always yes; case studies and testimonials typically yes; others vary by industry)
- Plan collection editor UI in content architecture step
- In Phase 1-2, build collection editors alongside the pages that use them
- Content Editor file list should never show collection-managed entries

### 18.7 Site-Clone Ready Method (ContentEditor Modular Pattern)

When duplicating BAAM for a new site, keep the refactored `ContentEditor` architecture and only swap site contracts/options. Do **not** return to a monolithic editor file.

**Required structure (recommended baseline):**

```
components/admin/
├── ContentEditor.tsx                    # Orchestrator only (load/save/list/routing)
└── panels/
    ├── SeoPanel.tsx
    ├── HeaderPanel.tsx
    ├── ThemePanel.tsx
    ├── BlogPostItemPanel.tsx
    ├── PortfolioItemPanel.tsx
    ├── ShopProductItemPanel.tsx
    ├── JournalItemPanel.tsx
    └── CollectionItemPanel.tsx
```

**Rules for all future site clones:**
- `ContentEditor.tsx` handles orchestration only: file list, active file, save/delete/duplicate, mode switch, shared callbacks.
- Each panel owns only its own UI fields and receives all state/actions via props.
- Site-specific differences are configured through content contracts + option sources (for example: `pages/portfolio.json`, `pages/shop.json`, `pages/journal.json`).
- Keep shared action APIs stable (`updateFormValue`, `openImagePicker`, `toggleSelection`, etc.) so panels are portable.
- Add new panel files for new collection types instead of adding large inline blocks.

**Clone workflow (fast and safe):**
1. Copy the admin panel structure as-is.
2. Update content contracts for the new industry/site.
3. Update option loaders (category/style/room sources) to new contract paths.
4. Enable/disable panel routes by file path prefix mapping.
5. Run Admin Done-Gate: create/edit/duplicate/delete + preview + JSON roundtrip for every enabled panel.

**Acceptance target for maintainability:**
- `ContentEditor.tsx` should remain an orchestrator (roughly under 1000 lines target).
- Complex forms should be extracted to `components/admin/panels/*`.
- New site customization should mostly touch panel files and contract config, not core orchestration flow.

## 19. Governance & Sign-Off

### 19.1 RACI Matrix

For a solo developer / small team BAAM build:

| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Stage A: Strategy & design | Developer + Claude | Founder (John) | Client (business owner) | — |
| Stage A gates: approve blueprint | — | Founder | Client | — |
| Phase 0: Infra + contracts | Developer + Cursor | Founder | — | Client |
| Phase 1-2: Build/Wire/Verify | Developer + Cursor | Founder | — | Client (preview links) |
| Phase 1-2: Per-page done-gate | Developer | Founder (spot-check) | — | — |
| Phase 3: SEO + hardening | Developer + Cursor | Founder | — | — |
| Phase 4: QA + launch | Developer | Founder | Client (UAT) | — |
| Phase 4: Go-live sign-off | — | Client + Founder | — | — |
| Phase 5: Content creation | Claude Teams + Developer | Founder | Client | — |
| Phase 5: Growth decisions | Founder | Founder | Client | — |

**For client projects (BAAM as service):**
- Client provides: business info, real content (testimonials, case studies, photos), approval
- Founder provides: strategy, technical execution, quality control
- AI provides: code generation (Cursor), content drafting (Claude), research

### 19.2 Phase Gate Sign-Off Protocol

Each phase ends with a gate review. For a solo/small team, this is a 15-30 minute self-review:

| Gate | Who Signs Off | What They Review |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Stage A complete | Founder | All 7 A-Gates pass (see Section 9) |
| Phase 0 complete | Founder | App boots, contracts seeded, admin shows files |
| Phase 1 complete | Founder | Core pages live, admin roundtrip works, design locked |
| Phase 2 complete | Founder + Client preview | All pages, forms work, mobile responsive |
| Phase 3 complete | Founder | Gap matrix 100%, Lighthouse >90, SEO elements in place |
| Phase 4 complete | Founder + Client | UAT pass, content swapped, production URL works |

**Rule: Don't skip gate reviews even on solo projects. A 15-minute checklist review catches issues that cost days later.**

---

## 20. Dual Timeline: Lean vs Full Launch

### 20.1 Lean Launch (Minimum Viable Site — 4 weeks)

For projects with tight deadlines or limited content availability:

| Phase | Duration | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Stage A | 3-4 days | Abbreviated: page map + contracts + visual direction only |
| Phase 0 | Day 1-2 | Infra + theme + contracts for Tier 1 pages only |
| Phase 1 | Week 1 | 5-6 core pages (Home, Services, About, Contact, Quote/Conversion) |
| Phase 2 | Week 2 | Blog hub (no posts yet), FAQ, responsive polish |
| Phase 3-4 | Week 3-4 | Admin wiring, basic SEO (sitemap, meta), deploy |

**What's deferred to post-launch:**
- Case studies (add as they come in)
- Testimonials page (build once 10+ collected)
- Programmatic SEO pages (Month 2-3)
- Blog content (publish post-launch)
- Comparison pages (Month 3+)
- Full performance optimization (Month 2)

**Lean launch content minimums:**
- 0 blog posts (hub exists, empty)
- 5-10 testimonials (embedded on Home/About only)
- 0 case studies (page exists, "Coming soon" or hidden)
- 15 FAQ items

### 20.2 Full Launch (Premium Site — 7 weeks)

The standard timeline from this plan:

| Phase | Duration | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Stage A | 1-2 weeks | Complete: all 6 artifacts, all 7 A-Gates |
| Phase 0 | Day 1-3 | Full infra + all contracts + all variants + seed |
| Phase 1 | Week 1-2 | 6-8 core pages + collection editors |
| Phase 2 | Week 3 | All remaining pages + forms + blog + polish |
| Phase 3 | Week 4 | Admin hardening + programmatic SEO + performance |
| Phase 4 | Week 5 | Full QA + content swap + production deploy |

**Full launch content minimums:**
- 6-10 blog posts published
- 20-30 testimonials displayed
- 6+ case studies with detail pages
- 25+ FAQ items
- 50+ programmatic SEO pages

### 20.3 Decision Criteria

Choose **Lean** when:
- Client needs to go live ASAP (e.g., business already operating, no web presence)
- Real content (testimonials, case studies) doesn't exist yet
- Budget is constrained
- Site is proof-of-concept for BAAM template viability

Choose **Full** when:
- The site IS the business (e.g., lead generation is primary revenue driver)
- Enough real content exists or can be created in time
- Competitive market where perceived scale matters (like LTL freight)
- This will become the BAAM template for the industry

---

## 21. Minimum Automation Checks

### 21.1 Why Automation

The QA matrix in Phase 4 is manual-heavy. For a solo developer, manual QA on 12+ pages with multiple checks per page is error-prone and tedious. Basic automated checks catch regressions early.

### 21.2 Automated Check Suite

Create `/scripts/qa-checks.ts` (or equivalent) that runs these checks:

**Schema Validation:**
- For every content JSON file, validate against its TypeScript interface
- Check: all required fields present, correct types, no unexpected keys
- Run: `npm run qa:schema`

**Route Smoke Tests:**
- For every public route, make an HTTP request and verify:
  - Response status 200
  - HTML contains expected `<h1>` text
  - HTML contains `<title>` tag (not empty)
  - HTML contains canonical URL
  - No console errors in server log
- Run: `npm run qa:routes`

**SEO Metadata Checks:**
- For every public route, verify:
  - `<title>` is unique and non-empty
  - `<meta name="description">` exists and is non-empty
  - `<link rel="canonical">` is present and correct
  - `og:title` and `og:description` present
  - `<h1>` exists and is unique on page
- Run: `npm run qa:seo`

**Link Checker:**
- Crawl all internal links, verify no 404s
- Run: `npm run qa:links`

**Content Completeness:**
- For each content JSON, check: no "[placeholder]", "TODO", "lorem ipsum" strings
- Check: all image URLs resolve (no broken images)
- Run: `npm run qa:content`

### 21.3 When to Run

| Check | When |
|-------|------|
| Schema validation | After every Phase 0 seed, after any content edit |
| Route smoke tests | End of Phase 1, end of Phase 2, before Phase 4 launch |
| SEO metadata | End of Phase 1 (core), end of Phase 3 (all pages) |
| Link checker | Before Phase 4 launch |
| Content completeness | Before Phase 4 content swap |

### 21.4 Phase 4 Integration

Add to Phase 4 done-gate:
- [ ] `npm run qa:schema` — 0 errors
- [ ] `npm run qa:routes` — all routes return 200
- [ ] `npm run qa:seo` — all pages have unique title + description + canonical
- [ ] `npm run qa:links` — 0 broken links
- [ ] `npm run qa:content` — 0 placeholder strings remaining

---

## 22. Rollback & Incident SOP

### 22.1 Deploy Rollback

**Vercel rollback (instant):**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Find last known good deployment (green checkmark)
3. Click "..." → "Promote to Production"
4. Site rolls back within seconds

**Git rollback:**
```bash
# Identify last good tag
git tag --list 'v*'

# Roll back to last good state
git revert HEAD    # If single bad commit
git reset --hard v0.3-launch-ready   # If need full rollback

# Force deploy
git push --force-with-lease
```

**Rule: Always tag before risky operations (Phase 3 SEO changes, Phase 4 content swap, any production deploy).**

### 22.2 Content Rollback

**Bad content push (wrong data saved in admin):**
1. Go to admin → Import/Export
2. Import last known good content export (use "overwrite" mode for affected files only)
3. Verify frontend reflects restored content
4. Re-export and commit new backup

**Prevention:**
- Export content snapshot before every Phase gate
- Export before any bulk content operations
- Store exports in git as versioned JSON

### 22.3 Database Incident

**Supabase data corruption or accidental deletion:**
1. Supabase dashboard → Database → Backups (automatic daily backups)
2. Restore from most recent backup
3. Re-seed any content changes made after backup timestamp
4. Verify admin and frontend both work

**Prevention:**
- Never run raw SQL on production without a backup
- Use seed scripts with UPSERT (not DELETE + INSERT)
- Test destructive operations on local/staging first

### 22.4 Incident Response Protocol

| Severity | Symptoms | Response Time | Action |
|----------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **P0 — Site down** | Production URL returns error | Immediate | Vercel rollback to last good deploy |
| **P1 — Major feature broken** | Forms not submitting, pages crashing | Within 1 hour | Identify bad commit, revert, redeploy |
| **P2 — Content error** | Wrong text, broken images, missing sections | Within 4 hours | Fix in admin or content rollback |
| **P3 — Minor visual issue** | Spacing off, color wrong, mobile glitch | Within 24 hours | Fix in next deploy cycle |

### 22.5 Post-Incident Checklist

After any P0 or P1 incident:
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix deployed and verified
- [ ] Added to anti-patterns list (Section 24)
- [ ] Prevention added to QA checks or Phase done-gates

## 28. REB Admin Reuse for New Site Setup

### 28.1 Decision

Yes, the REB admin improvements are **highly useful** for generating and setting up future sites.  
This work should be treated as a **reusable platform baseline**, not a one-off patch set.

### 28.2 What Can Be Reused Without Rebuilding

The following capabilities are now clone-ready and should carry forward as-is:

- Full collection lifecycle actions across key content types: `New Item`, `Save`, `Duplicate`, `Delete`
- Import/export and diff operations across sidebar content types: `Check Update From DB`, `Overwrite Import`, `Export JSON`
- JSON/form parity and richer form coverage for site settings and collections
- Dedicated table syncing for collections that require DB-backed runtime pages (for example `agents`, `events`, `new-construction`)
- Slug/path synchronization behavior for create/duplicate flows
- Media sync/import foundations so Media reflects content image usage
- RBAC updates for broker-level operational workflows in admin

### 28.3 What Is Still One-Time Per New Site

You still need per-site setup, but this is configuration, not feature re-implementation:

1. New Supabase project and schema migration
2. Environment variables and storage bucket configuration
3. Site/domain records and route mapping (`siteId`, locale/domain bindings)
4. Initial content import (source-of-truth decision: DB vs files)
5. Theme/branding content update (`site.json`, `header.json`, `footer.json`, `seo.json`, `theme.json`)

### 28.4 Rule for Future Projects

For every new BAAM site, **do not rebuild admin behavior from scratch**.  
Clone this admin baseline first, then perform only:

- site-specific content contract adjustments
- option list/data mapping changes
- project-level configuration and QA verification

### 28.5 Acceptance for Clone Readiness

Before declaring a cloned site ready, run one runtime sweep on 2-3 representative sections (for example `agents`, `events`, `guides`) and confirm:

- `Create -> Save -> Duplicate -> Delete` passes
- `Check Update From DB / Overwrite Import / Export JSON` are coherent
- DB tables and file content remain in sync after operations

---

## 29. Admin Certification SOP (One-Pass Cursor Checklist)

### 29.1 Purpose

This SOP is a single-run admin verification + remediation phase so Cursor can:

1. check all critical admin behaviors end-to-end,
2. fix issues in grouped batches,
3. re-run the same checklist,
4. finish with one final pass/fail report.

Goal: avoid one-by-one issue discovery and repeated back-and-forth.

### 29.2 When To Run

Run this as **Phase 3.5** (after Phase 3 hardening, before Phase 4 launch) and also:

- after major admin refactors,
- after adding new content types to sidebar,
- after RBAC/schema changes,
- after import/export or media pipeline changes.

### 29.3 Scope (What Must Be Certified)

The certification must cover:

- all left-sidebar content sections,
- all core admin actions (`New Item`, `Save`, `Duplicate`, `Delete`, `Format`),
- all sync actions (`Check Update From DB`, `Overwrite Import`, `Export JSON`),
- JSON/Form parity and field completeness,
- DB/file sync (including dedicated tables),
- media visibility/sync behavior,
- RBAC behavior for target roles,
- no destructive side effects after test cleanup.

### 29.4 Sidebar Coverage Matrix (Required)

Cursor must test each section below and mark `PASS` or `FAIL`:

- `site settings` (`site.json`, `header.json`, `footer.json`, `seo.json`, `theme.json`)
- `pages/*`
- `blog/*` (via Blog Posts editor boundary)
- `portfolio/*`
- `shop-products/*`
- `journal/*`
- `collections/*`
- `testimonials`
- `properties/*`
- `neighborhoods/*`
- `market-reports/*`
- `agents/*`
- `knowledge-center/*`
- `new-construction/*`
- `events/*`
- `guides/*`

### 29.5 Action Checklist Per Section

For each section/content type, execute this exact checklist:

1. Open a known file/item.
2. `Format` works and keeps valid JSON.
3. `Save` succeeds (expect `PUT` success).
4. `New Item` works (use disposable slug).
5. `Duplicate` works (new slug generated correctly).
6. `Delete` works for disposable item (expect `DELETE` success).
7. JSON tab edit and Form tab edit stay in sync after save.
8. If section is non-deletable/protected, verify correct guard message.

If browser prompt flows are automation-limited, use API-driven disposable create/duplicate fallback but still validate save/delete in runtime UI.

### 29.6 Sync Integrity Checklist (Global)

Run these once per locale/site combination:

1. `Check Update From DB` dry-run shows clear diff counts and changed paths.
2. `Overwrite Import` applies source-of-truth correctly (DB -> files).
3. `Export JSON` applies source-of-truth correctly (files -> DB).
4. Re-run `Check Update From DB` to verify no unexpected residual diffs.
5. Verify collection dirs are included in diff (`agents`, `knowledge-center`, `new-construction`, `events`, `guides`, etc.).
6. Verify slug-path consistency after create/duplicate across collection folders.

### 29.7 Dedicated Table + Content Entry Consistency

For relevant types (`agents`, `new-construction`, `events`):

- create/update/delete from admin must reflect in both:
  - `content_entries` path row
  - dedicated table row (`site_id + slug`)
- duplicate must write correct slug in both stores
- delete must remove from both stores

Record result as `PASS` only if both layers are consistent.

### 29.8 Media Checklist

Verify:

1. Media panel lists content-used images after sync/import.
2. URL normalization works for bucket and external-origin paths per policy.
3. Image picker updates content JSON and persists after save.
4. No broken media references in sampled pages/collections.

### 29.9 RBAC Checklist

At minimum test these roles on target site:

- `super_admin`
- `broker_admin`
- `site_admin` (if used)
- `editor` (write scope only where intended)

For each role validate visibility + action permission on:

- users, sites/domains, content actions, media actions, import/export actions.

### 29.10 Cursor One-Pass Execution Flow

Use this execution order in one Cursor run:

1. **Discover**: collect all sidebar sections and action handlers.
2. **Baseline**: run quick pass/fail matrix without edits.
3. **Batch Fix A**: action wiring bugs (`New/Save/Duplicate/Delete/Format`).
4. **Batch Fix B**: sync pipeline bugs (`check/import/export`, diff observability).
5. **Batch Fix C**: DB schema compatibility + dedicated table sync.
6. **Batch Fix D**: JSON/Form parity and panel completeness.
7. **Batch Fix E**: media sync/listing/normalization.
8. **Re-test Full Matrix**: same checklist, fresh pass.
9. **Cleanup**: remove disposable QA items.
10. **Report**: final pass/fail matrix + residual risks.

### 29.11 Required Deliverables

After this SOP run, Cursor must provide:

1. **Admin Certification Matrix** (section x action pass/fail).
2. **Sync Matrix** (`check/import/export` pass/fail with notes).
3. **RBAC Matrix** (role x capability pass/fail).
4. **Fix Log** (files changed + what issue each fixed).
5. **Residual Risk List** (if any) with owner and next action.

### 29.12 Exit Criteria (Phase 3.5 Complete)

Phase 3.5 is complete only when:

- all targeted sections pass action checklist,
- sync actions pass with no unexplained diffs,
- dedicated table/content consistency passes,
- JSON/Form parity passes for key settings and collections,
- media checks pass,
- disposable QA artifacts are cleaned up,
- final report contains zero P0/P1 admin defects.

## 26. Theme Token Normalization Playbook

Quick link: see `THEME_NORMALIZATION_SOP.md` for the daily execution checklist used in Cursor prompts and QA passes.

This section defines how to normalize `theme.json` and related styling work across every new BAAM site so design decisions are centralized, predictable, and admin-safe.

### 26.1 Goal

Create **one source of truth** for visual decisions:

- `theme.json` stores tokens (color, typography, radius, spacing rhythm, effects, detail layout)
- `[locale]/layout.tsx` maps tokens to CSS variables
- `styles/globals.css` provides defaults + utility/semantic classes consuming CSS vars
- page/components consume only utilities/CSS vars (no hardcoded visual literals)

If a style value appears more than once, it should become a token candidate.

### 26.2 Token Layers (Required)

For each site, keep these layers in `theme.json`:

1. **Foundation tokens**
   - `colors`, `typography`, `borderRadius`
2. **Behavior/effect tokens**
   - `opacity`, `effects` (hero overlays, media dim, card overlays, text shadows)
3. **Layout tokens**
   - global + section spacing, sticky offsets, detail-page structure
4. **Component tokens**
   - buttons, chips, media badges, card widths, recurring block patterns

Rule: foundation is generic, behavior/layout/component are allowed to be site-specific.

### 26.3 Naming Rules

- Use lowercase camelCase in JSON keys.
- Use semantic names first (`heroContentBottom`, `relatedGridLarge`) not implementation names (`gap7`).
- CSS variables use kebab-case with clear prefix:
  - `--detail-*` for detail-page tokens
  - `--hero-*` for hero/effect tokens
  - `--on-dark-*` for dark-surface text system
- Keep fallback values in CSS var mapping, not in page JSX.

### 26.4 Required Mapping Flow

Every tokenized value must follow this pipeline:

1. Add token in `theme.json`
2. Inject CSS variable in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
3. Add default fallback in `styles/globals.css`
4. Consume through:
   - semantic utility class preferred (`detail-section-title`, `detail-card-meta`)
   - direct `style={{ ...var(...) }}` only when utility is not appropriate

Never skip step 2 or 3.

### 26.5 Page Implementation Rules

- No hardcoded color hex in page components.
- No raw `rgba(...)` in page components when an effect token exists.
- Repeated spacing/gap/rhythm classes should be converted into semantic utility classes.
- Prefer semantic classes over long class chains:
  - `detail-back-link` instead of repeated `inline-flex items-center ...`
  - `detail-section-title` instead of repeated heading size/weight/margin/color bundles
  - `detail-card-title` and `detail-card-price` for repeated card metadata

### 26.6 Admin + Content Editor Compatibility

- `theme.json` remains editable from Content Editor (`site settings` scope).
- Any new token group added must:
  - preserve backward fallback behavior
  - not break existing pages if the token is missing
- Protected files list should continue to include `theme.json`.

### 26.7 Normalization Workflow (for each new build)

Run this in Phase 0 and continue during Phase 1-3:

1. **Audit**
   - scan target pages for hardcoded visual values (color, opacity, spacing, radius, shadows)
2. **Cluster**
   - group repeated values into candidate tokens
3. **Promote**
   - add tokens to `theme.json` using semantic naming
4. **Map**
   - wire into `layout.tsx` CSS variable injection
5. **Apply**
   - replace page literals with semantic utility classes
6. **Consolidate**
   - remove redundant micro utility classes when semantic class exists
7. **Verify**
   - lint, visual spot-check, admin roundtrip edit test

### 26.8 Done-Gate: Theme Normalization

Before Phase 3 is marked complete:

- [ ] Top pages + detail pages have no hardcoded visual literals that are already tokenized
- [ ] `theme.json` covers colors, typography, radii, effects, layout spacing, and key component sizing
- [ ] `layout.tsx` injects all active token groups with safe fallbacks
- [ ] `globals.css` contains semantic utilities for repeated patterns
- [ ] No duplicate utility classes for the same purpose
- [ ] Lint passes, and core pages visually match pre-normalization intent

### 26.9 Anti-Drift Rule

Any PR that introduces new hardcoded visual values must either:

1. justify why it is intentionally one-off, or
2. add/update tokens and utilities in the same PR.

This keeps BAAM sites maintainable and prevents style drift over time.

---

## 27. Platform Guardrails (Julia Studio Learnings)

This addendum captures implementation-level rules derived from Julia Studio production work. Keep these as non-optional guardrails for future BAAM builds.

### 27.1 Public vs Admin Data Access

- Public pages must never depend on `/api/admin/*` routes.
- Visitor-facing content should use public content loaders/endpoints only.
- Reason: admin auth/rbac behavior in production can return empty responses and make public pages appear blank.

### 27.2 Site Resolution in Multi-Site Environments

- Do not hardcode `siteId` in public client fetches.
- Resolve site context from host/domain by default, with explicit override only when required.
- Public APIs should accept optional `siteId` and safely infer from request host when absent.

### 27.3 Content Sync Direction (Import vs Export)

- **Import (overwrite):** DB -> local files.
- **Export:** local files -> DB.
- Before running either action, require an explicit source-of-truth decision for this operation.
- If `DB newer conflicts = 0` and DB is authoritative, import is the default safe path.

### 27.4 Slug Integrity Contract

- For collection entries, `slug` must always equal filename stem (path-derived slug).
- Create, save, and duplicate flows must enforce slug/path synchronization automatically.
- Diff tooling must include collection directories so slug mismatches are always detected.

### 27.5 Diff Observability Standard

- "Check Update From DB" outputs must include:
  - total changed file counts (`create`, `update`, `conflicts`)
  - folder-level breakdown (`portfolio`, `journal`, `shop-products`, etc.)
  - sample changed paths for rapid diagnosis
- Goal: make operator decisions obvious before any overwrite action.

### 27.6 Theme Token Governance

- Visual changes (font, color, radius, shadow, overlay, spacing rhythm) must be token-first:
  1. define in `theme.json`
  2. map to CSS variables in layout
  3. consume via semantic classes/utilities
- Avoid one-off visual literals in page components when a tokenized equivalent exists.

### 27.7 Admin Form Completeness Rule

- Complex content contracts (for example testimonials/services) require dedicated panel components, not monolithic inline editors.
- Required capabilities: add/remove/reorder, constrained options (dropdowns), media field support, and JSON/Form roundtrip parity.

### 27.8 Pre-Deploy Operational Checklist (Minimum)

- Run production build (`npm run build`) and ensure zero type/lint failures.
- Smoke test core listing pages (`portfolio`, `collections`, `shop`, `journal`) on target domain and both locales.
- Run sync dry-run and resolve direction (`import` vs `export`) before content operations.
- Spot-check at least one collection file for slug/path consistency after duplicate/create flows.

## 24. Anti-Patterns & Lessons Learned

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Hurts | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Skip Stage A (design) | Generic site, missing industry features, poor conversion | Always complete all 6 Stage A artifacts + 7 A-Gates before coding |
| Defer admin to late phase | Massive rework, content shape mismatches | Build → Wire → Verify per page in Phase 1-2 |
| Hardcode colors in components | Theme changes don't propagate | Theme tokens only, audit in Phase 0 |
| Manage blog in Content Editor | Editor confusion, filter bugs | Strict editor boundaries from Phase 0 |
| One giant ContentEditor.tsx | Hard to maintain, slow to add features | Refactor into sub-components, extract collection editors |
| All collections in Content Editor | Overwhelming file list, no purpose-built UI | Dedicated editors for blog, case studies, testimonials, FAQ |
| Build page without content contract | Frontend and admin shapes diverge | Contract-first: define JSON before coding UI |
| Placeholder JSON stubs in production | Admin shows empty/broken forms | Full realistic content in all JSON files |
| Skip roundtrip testing | "Works in JSON but not Form mode" | Done-gate requires Form → JSON → Save → Preview |
| Mix Supabase + local JSON sources | Inconsistent data, stale content | DB-first always, filesystem fallback only |
| Defer ALL SEO to Phase 3 | Core pages launch without meta/canonical | Shift-left: basic SEO metadata in Phase 1 for core pages |
| Programmatic pages before core works | SEO pages inherit bugs from templates | Core pages first (Phase 1-2), programmatic in Phase 3 |
| Skip performance audit | Slow site, poor Core Web Vitals | Lighthouse audit mandatory in Phase 3 |
| Launch with placeholder content | Looks fake, destroys trust | Content swap checklist + automated content check in Phase 4 |
| Reuse Supabase project across systems | Cross-client data leakage | Always create new Supabase project per system |
| Copy medical structure to new industry | Loses industry-specific features | Stage A designs industry-native architecture |
| No deploy rollback plan | Bad deploy stays live for hours | Tag before every deploy, know Vercel rollback steps |
| Manual-only QA | Regressions slip through | Minimum automated checks (schema, routes, SEO, links) |
| No content backup before changes | Lost work, no recovery | Export content snapshot at every Phase gate |
